# simple_interesting_calculator
A basic simple interest calculator in Python with details in README.md

## Overview
This repository contains a basic simple interest calculator implemented in Python. Simple interest is a quick method to calculate the interest charge on a loan or investment. It is calculated on the original principal only, without compounding.

## Formula
The formula for simple interest is:
- **Principal (P)**: The initial amount of money.
- **Rate (R)**: The annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 5% = 0.05).
- **Time (T)**: The time period for which the money is borrowed or invested (in years).

The total amount after interest is: `Total = Principal + Interest`.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the Python script
4. Enter the prompted values for Principal, Rate, and Time.
5. The script will output the calculated Simple Interest and Total Amount.

### Example
- Principal: 1000
- Rate: 0.05 (5%)
- Time: 3 years

Interest = 1000 × 0.05 × 3 = 150  
Total Amount = 1000 + 150 = 1150

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (no additional libraries needed).
